# Signoff

Context switching is slow and takes effort. This app aims to make it easier. It sits in the system tray, allowing you to *Sign off* for the day and *Resume* the next.

Based on the [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron-quick-start) app framework.

## Running

    npm install && npm start
